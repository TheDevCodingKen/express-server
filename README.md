This repository contains the source code for my Express.js server with Morgan logging.

The purpose of this project was:

- to become familiar with back-end framework, Express and middleware
- to become familiar with Morgan
- to build Express server that will:
  - respond to requests and return my app's resources
  - respond to GET requests with data from a JSON file

Steps Taken:

1. Clone a set of files from GitHub.
2. Create a server object.
3. Add a listener to handle incoming requests.
4. Make the server log a message to know where it is listening and the port number.
5. Launch my project on a local web server via npm.
6. Define routes for HTTP GET requests.
7. Conduct TDD (Test Driven Development) by writing code that passes HTML and JavaScript tests based on Mocha test framework.
8. Push my project into a GitHub repository.
